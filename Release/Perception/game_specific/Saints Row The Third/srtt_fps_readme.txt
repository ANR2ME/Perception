SRTT first-person camera experiment
ver. 0.4.1
by BadMadScientist
with slight tweaks to FOV by DrBeef for use with Vireio Perception

Warning
-------
Before I'll go into details, I have to move one thing out of the way: this mod won't turn Saints Row The Third into your favourite, award-winning firt person shooter. SRTT was meant to be TPP and that means turning it into FPP by an amateur modder (or just a person with my skills) is next to impossible. Not once and not twice you will run into a) bugs b) clipping issues c) animation and camera hiccups. Of course, I'm planning to get rid of them all eventually. As for now though, please feel encouraged to tweak this mod on your own (just remember to give proper credits to all of the people noted below), suggest things etc.

Alright, so what's it all about?
--------------------------------
Long story short, this mod is nothing else than a pack of camera repositions, animation tweaks and other gimmicks that all combined try to deliver as genuine FPS feeling to SRTT as it gets. Check out screenshots below and post your opinions!

This mod isn't bug free and - I fear - won't be for a long time. There are just too many things going on in SRTT to cover them all at once. Also, this mod is designed for post-campaign gameplay. For example, some missions force you to wear hats or face-wear (which covers your „eyes”) and cutscenes use different (sometimes forced) camera angles. To replay your favourite missions in FPS, I suggest using Mission Replay mod (by IdolNinja, gibbbed, Corrodias, luckz) and its „no forced outfits”version.

Installation
------------
1) Unpack the archive. 
2) Move unpacked xtbl files to Saints Row The Third main folder (for example: C:\steam\SteamApps\common\saints row the third).
3) Overwrite previously existing file if asked; keep in mind that mods that were using overwritten files will most probably bug out. 

Usage
-----
You can change your character's clothes like normal (just don't choose any hats, glasses or face-wear) and then see them during movement. Beware of clipping issues though! Clothes with high collars are usually getting into way much more often than the rest. 

If you wish to disable player's body (and play as "hovering arms"), undress your character's „lower part”.

Coop notes
----------
In previous versions, every player - a host or a guest, it didn't matter - with FPS mod enabled would end up seeing coop partner headless. Right now, however, any character's head will turn invisible only if that character is wearing a "Military Man" long chain. Can't see your coop partner's head (and know that he or she isn't using FPS mod like you)? Just ask him/he for removing the dog tag necklace from his character!

Credits
-------
- I build this thing on top of shitface's Vehicle Camera First Person Mod (a tune-up of quantumsingularity86's Vehicle Camera First Person Mod ) so it would be unfair to not credit him. Of course, you can press aim button while driving to enable vehicle's dashboard view.
- IdolNinja helped A LOT by posting the VIDs list on the board and pointing me to it.
- Letrune for helping out with coop issue and driver's head visibility fix
